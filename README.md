ThinkStats2
===========

Text and supporting code for [Think Stats, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)

Forked from author [AllenDowny](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2), this is based on edition 2.

Actually I'm reading the Chinese version, translated by Chenggang (who is also the translated author for book R graphic), and here is the online version [gitbook](https://jobrest.gitbooks.io/statistical-thinking/content/index.html)
